Starting a new project: 

1. Identify stakeholders

- Create a new org if you need to (or same org if same stakeholders)
- Invite stakeholders to the org
- Use GH teams for access control, even if it's a small project

2. Write project charter

> The project charter is the document issued by the project initiator or sponsor that formally authorizes the existence
of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.
It documents the high-level information on the project and on the product, service, or result the project is intended to
satisfy, such as:
1. Project purpose;
2. Measurable project objectives and related success criteria;
3. High-level requirements;
4. High-level project description, boundaries, and key deliverables;
5. Overall project risk;
6. Summary milestone schedule;
7. Preapproved financial resources;
8. Key stakeholder list;
9. Project approval requirements (i.e., what constitutes project success, who decides the project is successful, and
who signs off on the project);
10. Project exit criteria (i.e., what are the conditions to be met in order to close or to cancel the project or phase);
11. Assigned project manager, responsibility, and authority level; and
12. Name and authority of the sponsor or other person(s) authorizing the project charter.

At a high level, the project charter ensures a common understanding by the stakeholders of the key deliverables,
milestones, and the roles and responsibilities of everyone involved in the project.
