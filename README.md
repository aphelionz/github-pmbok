Starting a new project: 

1. Identify stakeholders

- Create a new org if you need to (or same org if same stakeholders)
- Invite stakeholders to the org
- Use GH teams for access control, even if it's a small project

2. Write project charter

- Create new org-wide "Project"
- Write project charter as note - should be very short
- README.md using standard readme
